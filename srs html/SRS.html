      University. This is the first release of the software. This SRS covers the entire product requirements. This SRS
      contains the product description for the entire system and this SRS will be followed by an SDS. However, there
      might be revisions to this SRS once a deeper understanding of the problem is achieved.
    </p>
    <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
    <p>The standard convention that will be followed when writing this SRS is that standard Arial font will be used when
      writing
      this. Text that is in italics will be used to indicate special information. The words in bold will either be
      heading for
      various segments of this document or keywords that will be explained. Every requirement statement will have its
      own priority
      that will be stated. All titles for figures or diagrams will be in italics.</br>
      Main Topics: Font Name: Arial, Font Style: Bold, Size: 11</br>

    <p>This document is intended for the use of developers, project managers, business analysts, users, testers, and
      documentation writers. The SRS contains an overview of the product, External Interface Requirements, System
      Features, performance requirements, and additional requirements.SRS will provide readers with a better
      understanding of the finer details of this project. By understanding the project, business analysts will be able
      effectively to communicate with the developers and the clients. The document is written in simple English for a
      wide range of audiences. The developer team will be most benefited from the document as with will work as a guide
      for the entire project. In order to read this document, the reader should begin from the overall description of
      the product and move sequentially according to the table of contents for a detailed understanding of the product.
      However, the most pertinent segments are the Design and implementation segments and the user classes segment which
      provides an understanding of the design of the software. Alongside that, the system features segments is essential
      to cross-check if the clients' requirements are met.</p>
    <h3 id="1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
    <p>This software is for in-house use for the employees and students of North South University. This system allows
      for a smooth complaint lodging system for students, faculty members, and staff through a website application and
      an Android application. Its purpose is to enable a smooth and efficient system that addresses all complaints and
      ensures greater efficiency in reaching the desired person who needs to process the complaint. The benefit of this
      system is that it replaces the need for people to individually send emails for sending a complaint where
      follow-ups and additional updates are difficult to visualize. One of the key benefits is that this platform
      organizes the complaints therefore saves time and money. The objective of the system is to implement a hassle-free
      complaint lodging system for all parties involved in North South University. This software is largely not used for
      business purposes but rather for providing a service on behalf of North-South University. The business goal to be
      achieved from this implementation is a provide a good user experience for students and their employees.

    <!-- Section 2 starts here -->

    <h3 id="2">2. Overall Description</h3>
    <p>
      This section deals with a broad overview of the product NSU complaints system where the functionalities and goals
      that the software aims to achieve are noted. It also provides details on the dependencies, constraints, operating
      environment of the product along with user classes and user manuals.
    </p>
    <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
    <p>The product specified in this SRS is of a complaint system to be used by the members of North South University.
      The existing student service software “RDS” does not currently have an option to record complaints and this system
      does not integrate with it nor does it rely on fetching any of the data stored in the RDS database. The system is
      a new product in itself and allows users to lodge complaints so that they may be handled in a controlled manner by
      the concerned personnel.
    </p>
    <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
    <p>The product functions are fixed for all users as this has only one use: complaint management. The product is used
      by the people in NSU to lodge complaints against other people at NSU. There is a reviewer that addresses these
      complaints and resolves the issue; afterward, that complaint is closed. There is also an admin account that has
      the ability to monitor account creation, deletion, and banning. They can also edit and close complaints..</p>
    <img src="useCaseDiagram.png" alt="yes">
    <h3 id="2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The user can access the software from two different platforms: Web and Android App. There are 4 actors for the
      software: user, admin employee, system admin, and the system. The user and reviewer can use both web and mobile to
      interact with the product. The admin can only use the web. The user can lodge multiple complaints to multiple
      people and receive complaints that are addressed to them. Edit complaints and view previous versions of
      complaints. Assign a person to review the complaint. The user can also post comments and replies. The reviewer can
      view and review complaints where they are assigned as the reviewer. Leave comments and close complaints when
      necessary. Admins can manipulate accounts (create or disable). They can close complaints as well. All the users of
      the system except the admin must have NSU ID’s to have access to the system. The Android app also accesses all
      functionalities available on the web app other than the option for signing up.</p>
    <h3 id="2.4">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
    <p>The operating environment of the NSU Complaints App is listed as follows:</br>
      Platform: Web and Android</br>
      Web server: Any node server</br>
      Client System: Any system with a modern web browser running ES6 or for android with android version 6+
      minimum.</br>
      Database Configuration: MySql</br>
      Platform Requirements: </br>
      Windows 7 or later, MacOS and Linux; Android Marshmallow 6.0 or later</br>
      Hardware Requirements:</br>
      An Intel Pentium 4 processor or later that's SSE3 capable
    </p>
    <h3 id="2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
    <p>The option to record complaints using voice and taking pictures is only available on the android app but it is
      not available on the web. People using devices with Android versions lower than 5 (Marshmallow) can not use the
      android version of this application. For voice search, it relies on google speech to text API and will not work if
      Google is down. For the android app, there is a constraint that no backend framework can be used other than java
      and kotlin.No external APIs can be used for the backend for the web.</p>
    <h3 id="2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
    <p>The product will provide users with basic running instructions and a short l video that shows how to use the
      entire software.</p>
    <h3 id="2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
    <p>Assumptions:</br>
      1.Users have a stable internet connection</br>
      2.They have a modern browser</br>
      3.Have access to an android device</br></br>

    <h3 id="3">3. External Interface Requirements</h3>
    <h3 id="3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
    <p>A first-time user of the app should see the Role Selection screen and depend on the selected role, the user will
      be redirected to the role-specific login page. Users can log in using the email used to sign in or their google
      account (which will require NSU ID and a scanned picture).
      At the bottom of the login page, there should be a Sign-Up button that redirects users to the Sign-Up webpage
      using the default browser.</br></br>
      Upon successful login, the user should be at the main homepage where they have to fill the required fields to
      submit a complaint. The fields require information such as the complaint description, who the complaint is
      against, evidence submission, who should review the complaint. This is done using a create complaint icon and then
      the form is visible. The dashboard will have a view of complaints and there will be a show more button that lets
      users view more details. The edit complaint button serves as the form to edit the past complaint.The edit icon
      shows a drop-down with the previous versions of the complaints. The comment button shows a view of the thread of
      comments and allows to post comments. The is a profile icon that allows the users to see their profile details. On
      the navigation bar, there is a logout option for all users. There’s also a notification button that shows the user
      the latest updates. For the admin UI, there are buttons to add accounts, disable accounts, icons to create
      accounts. The admin UI will have the same navigation bar as the user Ui but with an added search bar.

    </p>
    <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The mobile version needs:</br>
      - Microphone access for speech to text and speech recording</br>
      - Camera access to scan and upload ID cards</p>
    <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
    <p>- React.js is our front end framework</br>
      - XML is android front end framework</br>
      - Express.js as our backend framework</br>
      - MySql as our Database</br>
      <h3 id="3.4">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
      <p>Both web and the android app will communicate through the REST API. The system also interacts with the Google
        Sign-in API granted by google</p>

      <h3 id="5">5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h3>
      <h3 id="5.1">5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
      <p>The performance requirement for the system is that system must be usable for all browsers that are currently
        used. The site must be loaded on
        the user's end completely in under 5 seconds. The app must be deployed in all versions of android operating
        systems without damaging the system
        of the device. The database used in the system must be updated in real-time with minimal delays. </p>
      <h3 id="5.2">5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
      <p>1. Targeted Harassment</br>
        a. Students can be picked on by bullies. The platform can be weaponized if people target a student with various
        complaints to get them in
        trouble with the authorities.</br></br>
        Solution: When such cases of targetting occur, the admin need to disable the commenting against a student</br>
        2. Can cause cases of vigilantism</br>
        a. If the complaints are open to everyone. A certain complaint could garner public scrutiny. People who are
        deeply
        affected may take things
        to a personal level rather than let the due process be carried out.</br></br>
        Solution: Complaints will be confidential and so only the involved parties can view them. This will help ensure
        that the complaints remain private and does not garner any attention.</p>
      <h3 id="5.3">5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
      <p>For users with a G-Suite email, authorization and authentication are handled by the npm package ‘React Google
        Login’ which is a Google OAuth
        Sign-in / Log-in Component for React. The data type is validated whenever input is taken from the user to ensure
        that parameters are of the
        correct type: numeric, text, etcetera. The format for data is also validated so that they follow proper
        guidelines. Both the web app and the
        Android app shall not execute any commands embedded in data provided by users that force the application to
        manipulate the database tables in
        unintended ways. All passwords received from the users shall be encrypted and will not be visible to the users
        of
        the database. Each general
        users’ privileges are limited to only what is required for them to be able to successfully fulfill their
        functional requirements. Admins will
        enjoy a higher level of privilege compared to general users but they too shall be restricted so that they are
        not
        able to perform any operations
        which may compromise the overall security of the application and the integrity of the data stored in the
        database.
      </p>
      <h3 id="5.4">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
      <p>The internal architecture of the software must be clean and simple so that if the need to change/test/maintain
        the software arises, it can be done with ease.</br>
        Software must ensure correctness, that is, it should perform the necessary tasks correctly and without any
        instance of bugs and errors.</br>
        Ease of use is another necessary attribute as the software should have an interface that is clean and easy to
        use
        without having to do extensive research.</br>
        The software must be efficient in performing its required task. It should be able to complete its required tasks
        with the available hardware in an optimum amount of time.</br>
        Maintainability: Each version of the software should be easy to maintain. The code should be structured and
        clean
        so that new code can be easily added to the software</br>
        Interoperability: The software must be able to communicate with other solutions with ease.
      </p>
      <h3 id="5.5">5.5 Business Rules</h3>
      <p>There are 5 roles available in the system. This includes the students, the helper staff, the system admin, the
        admin employee, and the faculty members. Under specific circumstances such as in the case of the helper staff,
        they can sign up without using their NSU email ID. Under specific circumstances there might be a need to disable
        a particular account, the system admin can perform that operation.</p>
